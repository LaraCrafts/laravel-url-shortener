## Installation
You can easily install this package using Composer, by running the following command:

```bash
composer require laracrafts/laravel-url-shortener
```

### Requirements
This package has the following requirements:

- PHP 7.1 or higher
- Laravel (or Lumen) 5.1 or higher

### Laravel 5.5+
If you use Laravel 5.5 or higher, that's it. You can now use the package, continue to the [usage](#usage) section.

### Laravel 5.1-5.4
If you're using an older version of Laravel, register the package's service provider to your application. You can do
this by adding the following line to your `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
   ...
   LaraCrafts\UrlShortener\UrlShortenerServiceProvider::class,
   ...
],
```

### Lumen
If you're using Lumen, register the package's service provider by adding the following line to your `bootstrap/app.php`
file:

```php
$app->register(LaraCrafts\UrlShortener\UrlShortenerServiceProvider::class);
```

## Usage
The shortener can be retrieved from the container in two ways:

```php
// This works in both Laravel and Lumen
$shortener = app('url.shortener');
// This only works in Laravel 5.2+
$shortener = url()->shortener();
```

Once you have an instance of the shortener, you can shorten your URLs:

```php
// This will return your shortened URL as a string
$shortener->shorten(...);

// This will return a promise which will resolve to your shortened URL
$shortener->shortenAsync(...);

// You can also call shortening from Laravel's url component directly
app('url')->shorten(...);

// or...
url()->shorten(...);

// or even...
UrlShortener::shorten(...);
```

This package relies on Guzzle's promise library for its asynchronous shortening, read their
[documentation](https://github.com/guzzle/promises) for more information.

You can also use dependency injection to inject the shortener into a method:

```php
class MyController extends Controller
{
    public function myFunction(ShortenerManager $shortener)
    {
        $shortener->shorten(...);
    }
}
```

The shortener exposes the following methods:

Method         | Description
---------------|-------------------------------------
`shorten`      | Shorten the given URL
`shortenAsync` | Shorten the given URL asynchronously
`driver`       | Retrieve a driver (e.g. `tiny_url`)
`extend`       | Register your own driver

### Changing the driver
You can change the default driver by setting `URL_SHORTENER_DRIVER={driver}` in your environment file or publishing the
config file and changing it directly.

### Adding your own drivers
Much like Laravels [core components](https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/extending#managers-and-factories), you can add your
own drivers for this package. You can do this by adding the following code to a central place in your application
(preferably a service provider).

```php
UrlShortener::extend('my_driver', function () {
    return new MyCustomUrlShortener();
});
```

If you are adding a web hosted shortener service you may want to extend the `RemoteShortener` abstract class, for which
you can use the shipped drivers (e.g. `TinyUrlShortener`) as an example as to how.

If you wrote a custom driver that others might find useful (such as a public online shortener service), please consider
adding it to the package via a pull request.

### Usage in CLI


The _URL Shortener_ package also introduces the `shorten` artisan command, this command will allow you to easily shorten URLs via the command line.

**Usage:** 
```bash
php artisan shorten {url} --driver={driver}
```

This example will result in the following output:
```bash
URL shortened successfully.
Your short URL is: https://driver.com/sh0rT
```

> Note: If the driver option is not present, the default driver will be used.

can be defined and accessed under the Dynamic Links menu. 

The suffix can have the value `SHORT` or `UNGUESSABLE`.
